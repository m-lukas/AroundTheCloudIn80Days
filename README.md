# Around the world in eighty days! 🌎

Make cloud computing more sustainable by maximizing your usage of renewable energy!

## Overview

Our application consists of three components:
- backend
- frontend
- updater

Based on the [most recent energy data](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/generation/r2/actualGenerationPerProductionType/show), the backend calculates the datacenter with the currently highest share of green energy available. The frontend accesses the information of the backend and displays it in a human-understandable way.

In the best case we wouldn't need the updater. It just exists, since we can't get the API-key of the ENTSO-E live-API on the weekend and therefore it simulates getting live data.

## Setup

Please follow following steps to get the application running:

1. [Have poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
2. Install dependencies and select the environment:
   ```console
   $ poetry install
   $ poetry shell
   ```
3. Start the webserver:
   ```console
   $ uvicorn main:app
   ```
4. And in another terminal start the updater:
   ```console
   $ python updater.py
   ```
5. Open [`frontend/index.html`](frontend/index.html) in your browser.

And that is already it. Enjoy!
